# Chess
In the future, this will be the repository hosting a chess engine. At the moment, I am writing my thesis, and only created a simple tic-tac-toe game with an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm with a couple simple optimizations such as always blocking an immediately winning move. To get the AI into a losing position, the board must be modified prior to beginning the game.
